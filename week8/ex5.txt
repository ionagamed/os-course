# Difference between physical and virual addresses

**Physical address**:
  - Always resembles the actual structure of memory.
  - Thus, the amount of physical addresses is __always__
    equal to the actual memory size
  - Different processes should use different physical 
    addresses, as they would intersect otherwise
    
**Virtual address**:
  - Doesn't neccessarily resemble the actual structure
  - Thus, the amount of addresses __may not be equal__
    to the memory size
  - Different processes __could__ both have a byte with
    address 0x40 (example), because it would be mapped
    in the MMU to different physical addresses
  - Allows "overbooking" the RAM - e.g. when two
    processes A and B require 10G and 15G respectively,
    while using only 3G and 5G, system can allocate them
    memory on a machine with only 8G of RAM (thus
    freeing the program from manually allocating
    "just enough memory")
