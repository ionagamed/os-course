Left one (ex3_1.c) will output 'Hello' twice, 
because with fork() the address space is copied 
into the forked process, thus sharing the buffer
between the two instances.

The buffer won't be empty because the default 
behaviour of the buffer is to flush either
on a line break or when the buffer is overflowed,
thus inserting a '\n' in the other variant (ex3_2.c)
gives the expected behaviour.
